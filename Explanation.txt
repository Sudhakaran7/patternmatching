Subi is fond of strings and pattern, so she wants to develop an algorithm that,
given an input string S and a pattern P, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.
'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
Constraint: The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Input Description:
S a string aand in next line, P pattern for matching for the string S

Output Description:
True or False

Sample Input:
baa
.*

Sample Output:
True

Explanation:
the given string is "baa", and ".*"
the "." represents the single character ->b
"*" represents zero or more of the preceding element ->aa
so the output is True

Sample Input:
aa
a

Samle Output:
False

Sample Input:
cdgg
d.*

Sample Output:
False

Sample Input:
guvi
gu.i.

Sample Output:
